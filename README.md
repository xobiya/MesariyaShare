# MesariyaShare (መሳርያ ተጋሩ)

A community-focused tool-sharing web app built with React and Vite.

This repository contains the frontend application for MesariyaShare — a project aiming to make it easy for neighbors to share and rent tools.

## Current status
- Frontend: React + TypeScript, built with Vite. (Active)
- No separate backend code is present in this repository (single-app Vite project). If you have a backend, it lives in a different repo or folder.

## Tech stack (observed from this repo)
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite (dev server and build)
- Radix UI components (various @radix-ui packages)
- Additional libraries: lucide-react, react-hook-form, recharts, sonner, embla-carousel, and other UI utilities

You can inspect `package.json` for a full dependency list.

## Quick start (local development)

Prerequisites:
- Node.js 18+ (recommended)

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the Vite dev server (by default on http://localhost:5173). Open the URL Vite prints in your terminal.

3. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

4. Preview the production build

```bash
npx vite preview
```

Note: If you prefer a static server, you can serve the `build/` folder with any static server after `npm run build`.

## Project layout (relevant files)

```

├─ index.html
├─ package.json
├─ vite.config.ts
├─ src/
│  ├─ main.tsx
│  ├─ App.tsx
+│  ├─ index.css
│  ├─ components/        # pages & UI components
│  └─ styles/            # global styles
└─ build/                # generated by `npm run build`
```

## Development notes
- The project uses a component-driven structure under `src/components` and a `ui/` folder with small UI primitives and wrappers.
- If you add environment variables for integrations (APIs, payments, etc.), create a `.env` file and do not commit secrets to the repository.

## Scripts
- `npm run dev` — start Vite dev server
- `npm run build` — build production files into `build/`

Check `package.json` for the exact scripts and additional tooling.

## Contributing

Small contributions are welcome. Typical workflow:

```bash
git checkout -b fix/some-issue
# make your changes
git commit -m "Short, meaningful commit message"
git push origin fix/some-issue
# open a pull request
```

Please include a description of what you changed and why. Add small, focused commits and keep PRs easy to review.

## License

This repository uses the license stated in `package.json` (check the `license` field). Update or add a `LICENSE` file if needed.

## Where to go from here
- If you expect a full-stack repo (frontend + backend), confirm whether the backend lives in a separate repo or sibling folder.
- If you'd like, I can:
	- Add a `preview` script to `package.json` (`"preview": "vite preview"`).
	- Add contributor and development guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md).
	- Add a small README badge list generated from `package.json`.
